## Welcome to GitHub Training

## Class Goals

During this class, you will learn:
- How Git and GitHub work together to track changes in your projects.
- How GitHub enables collaboration within your team.

You'll use this repo with GitHub's training on the Wheelhouse platform. When you're asked questions about a repository, this is where you'll find the answers. In addition, during the labs you can make changes directly on this repository and the changes will be reflected on Wheelhouse once they've been performed correctly. This way you get feedback about the work you've done.
